## Working in a Switchyard fleet

This repository uses Switchyard so that several AI agents can work in it
without overwriting each other. Each agent gets its own git worktree and
branch (\`fleet/<name>\`).

1. **Find your worktree before editing anything.** Run \`fleet list\` and match
   your own agent name. Work inside that directory — never in the main
   checkout. Editing the main checkout while other agents hold worktrees off
   it is the exact failure this tool exists to prevent.
2. **Run \`fleet check\` before you start on a file, not just before merging.**
   Checking only at merge time finds the collision after both agents have
   already done the work. A \`conflicts\` verdict means stop and coordinate;
   \`uncommitted\` means another agent has unsaved work there that merge
   simulation could not see. An agent named \`(main)\` is not an agent: it is
   uncommitted work in the main checkout itself, so someone is editing the
   shared tree directly.
3. **Re-read a guarded path before you write to it.** If \`fleet check\`
   reports one under \`guardedChanges\`, that shared file — one no repository
   tracks, so no worktree isolates it — moved since you spawned. Writing from
   the copy you read earlier silently drops whoever changed it.
4. **Do not create a worktree or branch yourself.** If \`fleet list\` has no
   entry for you, ask for \`fleet spawn <your-name>\` instead of running
   \`git worktree add\` — an untracked worktree is invisible to every other
   agent's \`fleet check\`, which is precisely the uncoordinated state
   Switchyard prevents.
5. **Validate before asking for a merge.** If the repo configures a
   \`validate\` command, commit your work and run \`fleet validate <your-name>\`
   — the recorded result is what \`fleet merge\` trusts, and a dirty worktree
   cannot be validated.
6. **Provisioning and merging are human actions.** Ask for \`fleet merge\`,
   \`fleet sync\`, or \`fleet pr\` by name. There is no agent-facing tool for
   them, by design.

This block is managed by \`fleet init\`; edits inside it are overwritten.
Full protocol: \`${SKILL_INSTALL_PATH}\`.
